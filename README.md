# SmoothScroll
Creates a smooth scrolling effect for the webpage. Normally when users scroll on a webpage, the scroll effect is not smooth. The 
default scroll behaviour is chunky. This class makes the scrolling experience much smoother. It attaches to the 'wheel' change event and
implements the scroll effect in much smoother manner.
